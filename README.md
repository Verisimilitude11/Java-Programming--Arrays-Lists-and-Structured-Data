# Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data

In this course, I learned to build on the software engineering skills I learned in “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software” by learning new data structures. I also learned how to use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java’s object-oriented features. At the end of the course I wrote an encryption program as well as a program to decrypt the encryption algorithm.

After completing this course, I am able to:
1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
